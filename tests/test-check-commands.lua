-- Test file to verify that test:check-flag and test:check-inventory
-- properly return "ok" or "fail" based on actual game state.
--
-- This test addresses the issue where these commands always returned "ok"
-- even when the tested condition was false, making it impossible to detect
-- test failures. After the fix:
-- - test:check-inventory returns "ok" when object IS in inventory, "fail" when NOT
-- - test:check-flag returns "ok" when flag IS set, "fail" when NOT set
