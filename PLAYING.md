# Playing Games Programmatically

This document explains how agents (or scripts) can play ZIL games to evaluate playability, test game content, or run walkthroughs.

## Overview

Use `llm.lua` to interact with games one command at a time. Each invocation loads a save, executes a command, captures the response, and saves state. This works across separate process invocations — no persistent Lua state needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start a new game (creates zork1.sav and zork1.sav.actions in /tmp)
lua5.4 llm.lua --new-game --save /tmp/zork1.sav

# Send a command
lua5.4 llm.lua --action "look" --save /tmp/zork1.sav

# Play through a sequence
lua5.4 llm.lua --action "open mailbox" --save /tmp/zork1.sav
lua5.4 llm.lua --action "take leaflet" --save /tmp/zork1.sav
lua5.4 llm.lua --action "read leaflet" --save /tmp/zork1.sav
```

## Output

Each command returns the game's text output directly (plain text, no JSON):

```
Ashworth Manor Gate
The iron gates of Ashworth Manor loom before you...
```

- **Exit code 0** — command executed successfully
- **Exit code 1** — error occurred (stderr shows `ERROR: ...`)

## How State Continuity Works

1. `--new-game` starts fresh, saves initial state, and resets the action history.
2. Each `--action` call restores state from the save file, replays the command, then saves the new state.
3. A JSONL action history (`<savefile>.sav.actions`) is maintained as a fallback if the binary save is unavailable.
4. Each invocation is a separate OS process — no Lua state persists between calls.

## Agent Play Loop

To play N turns of a game:

```bash
SAVE="/tmp/zork1.sav"

# Initialize
lua5.4 llm.lua --new-game --save "$SAVE"

# Play turns
for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  # Execute a command - output is plain text, exit code 0=success, 1=error
  lua5.4 llm.lua --action "look" --save "$SAVE"
done
```

## Using With an LLM Agent

An agent can play the game in a loop:

1. **Start**: `lua5.4 llm.lua --new-game --save /tmp/game.sav`
2. **Observe**: Read the plain text output
3. **Decide**: Choose the next command based on game state
4. **Act**: `lua5.4 llm.lua --action "<command>" --save /tmp/game.sav`
5. **Repeat** from step 2

The agent should:
- Use `look` or `examine` frequently to understand the current state
- Track inventory with `inventory`
- Try multiple approaches if a puzzle doesn't yield results
- Read any text the game presents (signs, leaflets, etc.)

## Basic Commands

| Category | Command | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Movement | `<direction>` or `go <direction>` | `north`, `go east`, `south`, `west`, `up`, `down` |
| Examination | `look`, `examine <object>` | `look`, `examine desk`, `x desk` |
| Inventory | `inventory` or `i` | `inventory` |
| Taking/Dropping | `take <object>`, `drop <object>` | `take key`, `drop key` |
| Containers | `open <container>`, `close <container>`, `look in <container>` | `open drawer`, `look in trunk` |
| Reading | `read <object>` | `read letter` |
| Pushing/Pulling | `push <object>`, `pull <object>` | `push button` |
| NPC Interaction | `ask <npc> about <topic>`, `tell <npc> about <topic>`, `show <object> to <npc>` | `ask hudson about master` |

Standard verbs: EXAMINE, TAKE, DROP, USE, OPEN, CLOSE, LOOK, READ, ASK, TELL, SHOW, GO, PUSH, PULL, TASTE.

## Command Reference

See [TESTING.md § How to Play](TESTING.md#how-to-play) for the full command reference.

## Available Games

Pass `--game <name>` to play different games:

| Game | Module |
|------|--------|
| zork1 (default) | `infocom.zork1.zork1` |
| lurkinghorror | `infocom.lurkinghorror.h1` |
| spellbreaker | `infocom.spellbreaker.z6` |
| planetfall | `infocom.planetfall.planetfall` |
| limehouse-killings | `books.limehouse-killings.limehouse-killings` |
| blackwood-horror | `books.blackwood-horror.blackwood-horror` |

## Command-Line Reference

```
lua5.4 llm.lua [options]

Options:
  --action, -a "cmd"   Execute this command
  --save, -s file      Save file path (default: savefile.sav)
  --game, -g name      Game module (default: zork1)
  --new-game           Start fresh, ignoring existing save
  --help, -h           Show help

Output: plain text to stdout
Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = error
```

## Companion Authoring Status

`llm.lua` currently accepts parser actions only. It does not yet load an
adventure's companion module or implement `--choices` and `--choose`.

For manual card play, use:

```bash
lua5.4 main.lua --companion <game-module>
```

For automated companion validation, a focused Lua test must currently load the
game and companion, call `COMPANION_QUERY` and `COMPANION_SELECT`, and resume the
game with the selected hidden command. The test must restore an independent
matching-state checkpoint for every candidate.

The proposed persistent authoring interface is not implemented yet.

Until that interface exists, do not document those operations as working CLI
commands. See
[`docs/GENERATING-COMPANION-ZIL.md`](docs/GENERATING-COMPANION-ZIL.md) for the
complete room/state-family coverage and validation requirements.

## Evaluating Playability

To assess whether an LLM can play and beat a game:

1. Start a new game
2. Give the LLM the game output and ask it to choose actions
3. Feed each action back via `llm.lua`
4. Track: rooms visited, items collected, puzzles solved, deaths
5. A game is "playable" if the LLM can make meaningful progress without getting stuck in loops

Example evaluation script:

```bash
SAVE="/tmp/eval.sav"
lua5.4 llm.lua --new-game --save "$SAVE" > eval.log

for turn in $(seq 1 50); do
  # In practice, an LLM would decide the action here
  ACTION="look"
  lua5.4 llm.lua --action "$ACTION" --save "$SAVE" >> eval.log
  EXIT_CODE=$?

  # Check for game end conditions or errors
  if [ $EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
    break
  fi
done
```
