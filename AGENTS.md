# Agent Guidance

Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). It is the canonical high-level summary of how this repository is structured.

## Fast Orientation

- Entry point for interactive play: [main.lua](main.lua)
- Loader and require integration: [zilscript/base.lua](zilscript/base.lua) and [zilscript/init.lua](zilscript/init.lua)
- Runtime environment and module execution: [zilscript/runtime.lua](zilscript/runtime.lua)
- Parser: [zilscript/parser.lua](zilscript/parser.lua)
- Compiler pipeline: [zilscript/compiler](zilscript/compiler)
- Test orchestration: [Makefile](Makefile)
- Generic pure-ZIL test runner: [run-zil-test.lua](run-zil-test.lua)

## Working Rules For Agents

1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing loader, runtime, parser, compiler, or content-loading behavior.
2. Prefer the narrowest layer that actually controls the behavior under change.
3. For compiler issues, start in the most specific emitter or lowering module under [zilscript/compiler](zilscript/compiler).
4. For content or gameplay issues, inspect the relevant adventure folder under [infocom](infocom) or [books](books) before changing engine code.
5. When debugging ZIL-related failures, prefer adding temporary `TELL`/print commands directly in the relevant ZIL routines to expose values, branch choices, and object locations while narrowing the problem. Remove or clearly quarantine this instrumentation before finishing unless it is intentionally part of a test.
6. Validate with the smallest relevant target from [Makefile](Makefile); for broad gameplay regressions, use `make test-pure-zil`.
7. Story prose withholds what must be examined and links what can be acted on. Follow "Prose Links" and "Withholding What Must Be Examined" in [docs/WRITING_ADVENTURES.md](docs/WRITING_ADVENTURES.md), and run `make lint-zil`, which checks vocabulary, link words, and every link target through the parser.

## Playing Games

To play a game programmatically (e.g. to test playability or run a walkthrough), see [PLAYING.md](PLAYING.md). It documents `llm.lua` for one-command-at-a-time game interaction.

## Writing Adventures

To create a new ZIL adventure from premise through release, invoke the **@game-writer** subagent:
```
@game-writer Design, implement, test, and release a ZIL adventure about <your-premise-here>.
```
It orchestrates construction through packaging, then staged quality assurance and remediation. The release gate keeps technical validation, blind functional play, artistic review, and audience/accessibility testing as independent perspectives. Each stage loads a corresponding skill (e.g. `skill foundation-and-premise`) for detailed guidance.

## Generating Companion Choices

To generate and validate a state-aware `companion.zil` for an existing
adventure, invoke the **@companion-author** subagent:

```text
@companion-author Generate, validate, and document complete full-game companion coverage for <game-name>.
```

The agent inventories the world and its state families, plays the adventure,
implements authored choices for every reachable room, executes every emitted
hidden command through the parser from an isolated matching-state restore, and
produces a machine-readable coverage manifest plus coverage and transcript
evidence. A companion numeric-only route must reach an ending;
fallback-only support in a reachable room is not complete coverage. The
authoritative workflow is
[Generating `companion.zil`](docs/GENERATING-COMPANION-ZIL.md); the runtime API
and authoring format are specified in
[Companion ZIL Files](docs/COMPANION-ZIL.md).

## Illustrating Adventures

To turn a playable adventure into a beat-illustrated interactive storybook,
follow [Illustrating Adventures as Interactive Storybooks](docs/ILLUSTRATING_ADVENTURES.md).
It defines the beat inventory, selection, generation, runtime mapping, and QA
workflow. Keep each adventure's visual identity separate in `ARTSTYLE.zil` and
`CHARACTER_DESIGN_BIBLE.md`; those files define how the book looks, while the
guide defines which dramatic moments receive art.

## Available Skills

The `.opencode/skills/` directory provides stage-specific skills loadable with the `skill` tool:

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `skill foundation-and-premise` | Defining premise, tone, and design doc |
| `skill working-materials` | Building MAP, OBJECTS, PUZZLES, STORY_STATE, TRANSCRIPT_TESTS |
| `skill world-model` | Validating puzzle fairness, parser vocabulary, softlock prevention |
| `skill content-writing` | Writing prose, NPC dialogue, layered hints |
| `skill zil-implementation` | Writing dungeon.zil, actions.zil, critical implementation rules |
| `skill testing` | Running transcripts, persistence tests, walkthrough hardening |
| `skill workflow-hints` | Review passes, hint UX, iteration planning |
| `skill packaging` | Release artifacts, definition of done |
| `skill playtesting` | Running tester play sessions and collecting bug reports |
| `skill artistic-review` | Reviewing narrative arc, genre craft, pacing, contrast, and ending quality |
| `skill accessibility-testing` | Testing target-audience usability and accessibility through explicit personas |
| `skill quality-assurance` | Coordinating independent technical, functional, artistic, and accessibility release passes |
| `skill bug-fixing` | Fixing ZIL bugs from QA reports (missing synonyms, broken containers, door/exit issues, etc.) |

## Current Repo Notes

- Imported Infocom materials are vendored as regular folders, not git submodules.
- Skills and staged adventure-building guidance live under [skills](skills).
- The root [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) file is intended to be the first-stop overview for future agent runs.
