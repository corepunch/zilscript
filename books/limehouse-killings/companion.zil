;"State-aware intent cards for The Limehouse Killings.

  This file adds a curated choice layer over the Victorian murder mystery.
  Labels describe narrative intentions; commands are ordinary parser input.
  The runtime evaluates SUGGEST-ACTIONS only while the game is waiting at READ."

;" NOTE: SUGGEST-ACTIONS and SUGGEST-SCENE must be defined after all
  room-specific helper routines because the ZIL-to-Lua compiler produces
  local functions, which cannot be forward-referenced. "
